# screenshot cog

this cog uses [pyppeteer](https://github.com/pyppeteer/pyppeteer) to take a screenshot of a given url

only the bot owner can use this command (`[p]screenshot`) for two main reasons:

1. a harmful user could potentially screenshot a nsfw website
2. a harmful user could potentially screenshot an ip grabber, giving them the ip address of the host machine
