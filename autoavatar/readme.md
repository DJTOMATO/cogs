# autoavatar cog

this cog lets you load up a bunch of avatars, and use a command to pick a random one

i recommend using bobloy's fifo cog to automatically do it 

users can use the you can use the `[p]currentavatar>` command to view the current avatar
users can use the you can use the `[p]listavatars` command to view all avatars in the list
users can use the you can use the `[p]submitavatar <link>` command to submit an avatar

you can use the `[p]addavatar <link>` command to add avatars to the list
you can use the `[p]removeavatar <link>` command to add avatars to the list

you can also use the `[p]avatarchannel current <channel>` command to set a channel where the current avatar will be displayed
you can also use the `[p]avatarchannel submissions <channel>` command to set a channel where the current avatar will be displayed
