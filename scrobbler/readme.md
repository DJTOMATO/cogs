# last.fm scrobber

for this to work, you'll need to make a application on last.fm's api here: https://www.last.fm/api/account/create

once you've done that you need to use these two commands:

`[p]set api lastfm appid <api_key>`
`[p]set api lastfm secret <shared_secret>`

now, users will need to use the `[p]fmlogin` command to authorize you to scrobble for them
